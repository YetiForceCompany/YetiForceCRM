Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software,  and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

a) Any file under this license must contain the content of the license or a link to the content of the license;
b) The Software must, if technically possible, be registered with the Software Manufacturer using the built-in form or via e-mail as described on the Producer’s website. Each Entity that uses, configures or modifies the Software is subject to registration, regardless of whether it registers the Software for itself or on behalf of other entities. In the case of groups of people, i.e. an organization, company, family or any group of people, it is enough to register only a group of people by providing the data of the organization / company or data of one person from the family / group. If, despite many correct attempts to register the Software, there is no reply from the Producer, the Entity may generate the registration keys on its own;
c) Data used for registration must be true. All provided registration information, including the company’s name, can be used by YetiForce S.A. (Ltd.) for marketing purposes (i.e. preparation of statistics, publication on the website).
YetiForce S.A. (Ltd.) does not sell or transfer that data to other entities and guarantees confidentiality of personal data.
d) The content of the system footer, printouts and emails (including links and mechanisms controlling product registration and purchase of paid products) cannot be changed in the system, unless a written consent from the Producer is obtained or an official addon sold by the Producer is purchased, which allows the purchaser to modify the footer. The color of the footer can be changed as long as the footer content remains legible.
e) In the case of products marked as paid, an appropriate license / subscription must be purchased from the Producer or an official Producer Partner;
f) The entity using the Software is obligated to keep a history of changes introduced into the Software and, at the request of the Producer, enable an inspection to verify that the Entity complies with the terms of this license. The inspection may not take place more often than once every 3 years;

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY,  WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

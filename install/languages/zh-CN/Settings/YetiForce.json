Flexible design of the solution allows multi store management, i.e integration of YetiForce with multiple stores based on the Magento engine. It also allows one central warehouse or multiple warehouses where each store has its warehouse. Regardless of stores number, YetiForce is always the master system that centralizes data from the Magento platform.
